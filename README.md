# emp-system
The Employee Management System is a full-stack application that allows users to manage companies, departments, and employees. It implements role-based access control (RBAC) for security, and features a workflow for onboarding new employees. The system supports CRUD operations for all entities and integrates with both the backend API and the frontend React application.

This application adheres to the following requirements:

-User authentication with role-based access control (RBAC). -Management of companies, departments, and employees. -Validation of fields (e.g., email and phone number format). -Workflow for onboarding employees, handling stages like "Application Received", "Interview Scheduled", etc. -Secure API with proper error handling and cascading deletions.
